					Step 1 - Basic evaluation
				</h4>
				<p>
					The basic investigation should include, in addition to the assessment of vital signs,
					a thorough medical history and careful clinical examination. A broad differential
					diagnosis is required to identify or rule out the most common causes of dyspnea.
					About two-thirds  of cases of chronic dyspnea are caused by heart or lung diseases.

				<h4>
					Step 2 - Targeted evaluation
				</h4>
				<p>
					Based on the overall clinical question and the findings from Step 1,
					targeted examinations are performed. If a diagnosis cannot be established after
					investigations according to Steps 1 and 2, early contact should be made with a specialist center.
